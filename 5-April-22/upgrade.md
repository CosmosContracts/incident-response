# Juno April 5, 2022 Chain Halt Upgrade

This upgrade is effectively a hard fork with the same chain-id. This means we'll need to delete all previous data and start from a new genesis.

NOTE: This assumes you've already ran through setting up a juno node here: https://docs.junonetwork.io/validators/getting-setup

## Performing the  Upgrade

### 1. Stop the node
```sh
sudo systemctl stop junod
```

### 2. Backup priv_validator_key.json
This is only relevant if you're upgrading your validator. Your priv_validator_key.json is how your validator is identified. If you haven't backed it up already, **DO SO NOW**.

An example method for doing so is as follows, which will copy your validator key to the home dir:
```sh
cd ~
cp ~/.juno/config/priv_validator_key.json .
```

*NOTE*: keeping your copy of the validator key on the same machine is NOT sufficient. At a bare minimum it should be backed up locally so you always have access to it.

### 3. Backup priv_validator_state.json
It's worth backing up your `priv_validator_state.json` in case this upgrade fails and an alternative path must be taken. 
```sh
cd ~
cp ~/.juno/data/priv_validator_state.json .
```
*NOTE*: Restore priv_validator_state.json file ONLY if we take the alternative path

### 4. Purge previous chain state and addrbook.json
Because we'll be starting from a new genesis, the previous data is no longer necessary.
```sh
junod unsafe-reset-all
```

### 5. Purge current peers and seeds from config.toml
This is done to ensure all peers are clean when moving forward. The addrbook.json file was already purged in the previous step.

**WARNING:** DO NOT DO BLANK PERSISTENT PEERS IF YOU ARE RUNNING SENTRIES. Only remove persistent peers that are not your sentries/val node.

```sh
sed -i.bak -e "s/^persistent_peers *=.*/persistent_peers = \"\"/" ~/.juno/config/config.toml
sed -i.bak -e "s/^seeds *=.*/seeds = \"\"/" ~/.juno/config/config.toml
```

### 6. Add seeds and peers to config.toml
These are all verified to be using the new genesis file and binary.

**WARNING:** These should be added manually if you are running a sentries setup, or you will blank out your peers.
```sh
SEEDS=""
PEERS="0dbe490d756c1c76d31c1c2dcd41b3e1036d0977@159.65.122.4:26656"
sed -i.bak -e "s/^seeds *=.*/seeds = \"$SEEDS\"/" ~/.juno/config/config.toml
sed -i.bak -e "s/^persistent_peers *=.*/persistent_peers = \"$PEERS\"/" ~/.juno/config/config.toml
```

### 7. Download and install the new binary

#### 7a. Install junod v3.0.0
This new binary includes the Lupercalia security upgrade.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/CosmosContracts/juno
cd juno
git fetch
git checkout v3.0.0
make build && make install
```

To confirm the correct binary is installed, do:
```sh
junod version --long
```

```sh
name: juno
server_name: junod
version: v3.0.0
commit: 268a9c0022d58488b0343c66fdcc5248aec4665d
build_tags: netgo,ledger
go: go version go1.17.1 linux/amd64
```

#### 7c. [OPTIONAL] If you use cosmovisor
You will need to re-setup cosmovisor with the new genesis.
```sh
rm $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/genesis/bin/junod
rm -rf $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades
mkdir $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades
cp $HOME/go/bin/junod $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/genesis/bin
rm $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/current
```

Check junod has copied to the new location.
```sh
$DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/genesis/bin/junod version

# returns
v3.0.0
```

### 8. Download the phoenix genesis

To build yourself or check options, [read more here](./genesis.md).

```sh
wget https://juno-phoenix-97.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/juno-phoenix-genesis.tar.gz
tar -xvf juno-phoenix-genesis.tar.gz -C $HOME/.juno/config

# check chain is juno-1, genesis time is correct & initial block is 2578099
# note if using zsh that you may need to break this up, and run steps individually
# i.e. cat $HOME/juno/config/genesis.json | jq '.chain_id'
cat $HOME/.juno/config/genesis.json | jq '"Genesis Time: " + .genesis_time + " â€” Chain ID: " + .chain_id + " - Initial Height: " + .initial_height'
```

### 9. Verify genesis shasum

```sh
jq -S -c -M '' ~/.juno/config/genesis.json | sha256sum
1839fcf10ade35b81aad83bc303472bd0e9832efb0ab2382b382e3cc07b265e0  -
```

### 10. Apply genesis
This is necessary in order to apply the genesis to the newly installed binary.
```sh
junod unsafe-reset-all
```

### 11. Start the node
```sh
sudo systemctl restart junod
```

### 12. Confirm the process running
```sh
sudo journalctl -fu junod
```

The output should be as follows:
```
4:58AM INF Genesis time is in the future. Sleeping until then... genTime=2022-04-07T21:00:00Z
```

## FAQ
### What about the gov prop upgrade?
The gov upgrade is being wrapped up into v3.0.0, so **the chain will no longer halt** at `2582000`  per Lupercalia Upgrade: https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/17

### What about ibc transactions?
They will time out and be returned to your wallets. 

### Do I need to resync?
Nope! We are effectively starting from "block 0" of the new genesis. Similarly, all snapshots no longer matter (except archive snapshots, for data integrity purposes). This is the perfect time to create a backup node or sentries if you didn't have them previously.

### What about staking rewards and/or commission?
These will be auto-claimed for you. Therefore, they are safe!

### How was the new genesis created?
The current state of juno-1 was exported from block `2578096`, one block before to the problematic one, then converted into a genesis file. Essentially that means all previously state was backed up as-is. Instructions for creating the genesis can be found here: https://github.com/CosmosContracts/incident-response/blob/main/5-April-22/genesis.md
